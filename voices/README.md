# Voice Samples Directory

This directory stores your voice samples for cloning.

## Quick Start

1. **Record your voice:**
   ```bash
   cd voice-cloning  # Or wherever you cloned the repository
   source venv/bin/activate
   python scripts/record_voice.py 120  # Record for 2 minutes
   ```

2. **Prepare the audio:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/prepare_audio.py
   ```

3. **Start cloning:**
   ```bash
   python quick_clone.py "Hello, this is my cloned voice!"
   ```

## Recording Tips

### Environment
- **Quiet room** - No background noise, fans, or AC
- **Consistent distance** - Stay 6-12 inches from microphone
- **Good quality mic** - Use headset or USB microphone if possible

### How Much to Record

**Tip**: More varied content is better than longer monotone recordings!

## File Structure

```
voices/
└── my_voice/              # Your voice profile
    ├── sample_*.wav       # Raw recordings (auto-generated)
    └── combined.wav       # Processed & combined (generated by prepare_audio.py)
```

## Multiple Voice Profiles

You can create multiple voice profiles:

```bash
mkdir voices/my_excited_voice
python scripts/record_voice.py --output voices/my_excited_voice/sample_001.wav

# Then use it:
python cli.py --voice my_excited_voice --text "Hello!"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Recording is silent
- Check microphone is connected and selected as input device
- Run `python scripts/record_voice.py --list-devices` to see available devices
- Test with: `arecord -l` (Linux) to verify microphone

### Poor quality output
- Re-record in quieter environment
- Speak louder and clearer
- Use better quality microphone
- Ensure 1-5 minutes of varied speech

### File not found errors
- Make sure you ran `python scripts/prepare_audio.py` after recording
- Check that `combined.wav` exists in voices/my_voice/
